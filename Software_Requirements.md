# Software Requirements
* **Ubuntu version:** Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS (Bionic Beaver) needs to be used in this project. In this case, it was installed in a VirtualBox virtual machine via the [Ubuntu image](https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/). My recommendation is to use the unattended installation and make sure to give it at least 25 GB of available memory, as after installing ROS and the TIAGo package we will occupy 15 Gb.

* **ROS:** Once Ubuntu is installed, ROS (Robot Operating System) must be installed. The version compatible with Ubuntu 18 is ROS Melodic, and its installation guide can be found [here](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu).

* **TIAGo Packages:** Finally, install the TIAGo packages for ROS Melodic. To do so, follow the instructions on [this website](http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/TIAGo/Tutorials/Installation/InstallUbuntuAndROS).
